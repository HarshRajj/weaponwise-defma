# DEFMA: Defence Fleet & Armament Management System

**DEFMA** is a comprehensive, modern solution designed to revolutionize logistics and management for the Indian Army. As a core developer on team **BugHunters**, I contributed to the design and implementation of this integrated platform, focusing on building robust features to enhance the efficiency, security, and real-time tracking of both vehicle fleets and KOTE (armoury) equipment.

This project moves beyond traditional, manual register-based systems, introducing a robust, digital-first approach to solve critical logistical challenges faced by our defence forces.

## üöÄ Core Modules & Key Features

DEFMA is composed of two primary, interconnected modules:

### 1. **Fleet Management Module**
This module provides a reliable and automated way to manage and track defence vehicle fleets in real-time, replacing manual odometer tracking with a comprehensive, data-driven system.

* **Real-Time Vehicle Tracking:** Monitors a wide range of vehicle parameters, not just mileage.
* **Automated Anomaly Detection:** The system automatically alerts the person-in-charge and the driver of any abnormalities in vehicle parameters, ensuring proactive maintenance and safety.
* **Centralized Dashboard:** Provides a clear, at-a-glance view of the entire fleet's status and health.

### 2. **WeaponWise KOTE Management Module**
This module digitizes the management of KOTE (armoury), making the process of tracking equipment more efficient, secure, and effortless for army personnel.

* **Digital Entry System:** Eliminates the need for conventional, hard-to-maintain registers for storing equipment issue and return entries.
* **Automated Alert System:** Automatically alerts the admin when a piece of equipment is not returned within a specific time frame, a task that was previously manual and prone to error.
* **Enhanced Security:** Built with all standard protocols of the Indian Army in mind, and incorporates additional security measures to ensure the integrity and safety of armament management.
